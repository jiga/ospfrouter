<p><b>Q. </b> What is OSPF?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is the next generation Internet routing
protocol. The &quot;Open&quot; in its name refers to the fact that OSPF was
developed in the public domain as an open specification. The &quot;Shortest Path
First&quot; refers to an algorithm developed by Dijkstra in 1978 for building a
self-rooted shortest-path tree from which routing tables can be derived.</p>

already a daemon </u>!. You just have to enable it by editing the &quot;main.c&quot;
file in the directory <i>ospfrouter</i>, uncomment the line containing daemonize()
in the main() function, save the file and recompile the software as described in
section 2.3 above.</p>
